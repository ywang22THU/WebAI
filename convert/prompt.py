     You are an expert in Web Interaction. Here is your task: 
     
     I will give you a description and a url.
     
     The description is a sentence that describes what I want you to do.
     The url is the page that I want you to interact with.
     
     Your task is:
     1. Convert the natural language description into a python dictionary.
     2. The dictionary should have the following keys:
        - "url": the url of the page you want to interact with, this value is given to you.
        - "action": what kind of action want the user do.
          For example, "action": "Search"
        - "page_info": what kind of information the user may want to get from the page.
          For example, "page_info": "search_results"
        - "keyword": if the interaction needs the user to search for something, the keyword should be included here.
          For example, "keyword": "Python"
        - "about": this other information about the request.
          For example, "about": "I want to search for Python on this website."
     
     The dictionary should be in the following format:
     {
        "url": "https://www.example.com",
        "action": "Search",
        "page_info": "search_results",
        "keyword": "Python",
        "about": "I want to search for Python on this website."
     }
     
     Note: 
     1. The dictionary should be in the correct format, with the correct keys and values.
     2. You can add other key-values into the dictionary if needed. But you cannot remove any key-value mentioned above.
     3. Only return the dictionary, not extra explaintion.
